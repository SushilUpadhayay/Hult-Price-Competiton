Myself with other 3 college friend participated in the College level Hult price competiton. Our topic was "Extracting Ethanol from algae". Algae pollutes the water bodies and causes eutrophication which reduces oxygen level on water that negatively impacts aquatic life ultimately harming water ecosystem. Our idea was to clean up the water bodies by removing algae from them and extreacting ethanol. We also discussed about extracting ethanol through algae cultivation via photobioreactor.
