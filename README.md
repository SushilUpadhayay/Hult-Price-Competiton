As part of a team of four college students, I participated in the college-level Hult Prize competition, where we proposed an innovative solution titled “Extracting Ethanol from Algae.” Our project addressed two critical global challenges: water pollution and renewable energy production.

We focused on the excessive growth of algae in water bodies—a major cause of eutrophication, which depletes oxygen levels and severely disrupts aquatic ecosystems. Our idea aimed to tackle this environmental hazard by systematically removing algae from polluted water sources, thus contributing to ecosystem restoration, while simultaneously processing the biomass to extract ethanol, a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

To extend the impact and scalability of our solution, we also proposed cultivating algae in photobioreactors, allowing controlled, high-yield production of ethanol under optimized conditions. This integrated approach not only supports clean energy development but also promotes ecological recovery, aligning with the Hult Prize mission of using entrepreneurship to drive meaningful global change.
